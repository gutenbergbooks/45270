<div class='poem'>
Baby, of all mysterious things,<br />
You're stranger far than stars or kings.<br />
You stare superbly day by day,<br />
Nor let your large reserve give way.<br />
Unfathomable mysteries<br />
Lurk in your big, unseeing eyes,<br />
Making brave memories, and yet,<br />
Making them only to forget.<br />
But though reflectively you blink,<br />
Trying to make us think you think,<br />
We know you cannot think or talk,<br />
You cannot run, you cannot walk;<br />
You little human mystery,<br />
You can't do anything but be.<br />
<br />
You small, content, safe-guarded thing,<br />
Nestling beneath your mother's wing.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>You're all so new; your roseleaf skin,<br />
Your dewy eyes and dimpled chin,<br />
Your pinch of hair and pound of flesh<br />
Are all so delicate and fresh.<br />
Then, Baby, every little while<br />
You cry. And then perhaps you smile.<br />
You cry without a bit of reason,<br />
You laugh both in and out of season;<br />
A wise proceeding, I suppose,<br />
If that is all the speech one knows.<br />
<br />
But sometimes do the dull hours drag?<br />
And sometimes does your patience flag?<br />
Long days and nights you must get through,<br />
Without a single thing to do.<br />
And though perhaps you see and hear,<br />
It means naught to your eye and ear.<br />
But, Baby, you don't seem to care,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>You hark at silence,&mdash;look at air!<br />
<br />
And in the stillness, or the dark,<br />
Absorbedly you look and hark.<br />
So, then, what difference can it make,<br />
Whether you are asleep or 'wake?<br />
You cannot think, and it would seem<br />
You do not know enough to dream.<br />
How can you dream, not knowing words?<br />
Or is it like the song of birds,<br />
Or scent of flowers, or sunshine bright,<br />
Or South breeze on a summer's night?<br />
<br />
Perhaps your thoughts just flounder 'round<br />
In seas of color, waves of sound;<br />
In notions vague of shape or form.<br />
As,&mdash;Life is something soft and warm.<br />
Mother is just a happy place;<br />
Nurse is a sort of vacant space.<br />
And father is a kind of stuff,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>That's woolly, black and rather rough.<br />
<br />
And then some day into your eyes<br />
There comes a look exceeding wise.<br />
And then your brain begins to grow;<br />
You learn "How does the Kitty go?"<br />
You learn to "Love the Lambie Baa,"<br />
And "Make a Face at Grandmamma!"<br />
And then upon your own account<br />
You seem to learn a large amount,<br />
As you laboriously prove<br />
That your own fingers really move!<br />
And if you have accomplished this,<br />
And if you've learned "a Spanish kiss;"<br />
And if three times you've said "Goo&mdash;goo!"<br />
Why, that's a busy day for you!<br />

Queer, drifting fancies, vague and dim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath his gold curls are hid.</span><br />
The kitchen steps appear to him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of a pyramid.</span><br />
<br />
With mighty purpose in his mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He clambers up. And then,</span><br />
With purpose quite as well defined,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scrambles down again.</span><br />
<br />
Then, of all busy ones of earth,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toilers beneath the sun,</span><br />
Working away for all they're worth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is the busiest one!</span><br />
<br />
Down in the sand he has to dig<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A hole, exceeding deep;</span><br />
And by its side, all smooth and big,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">He piles a lovely heap.</span><br />
<br />
With both hands then he scatters it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round the verandah floor;</span><br />
And when he's scattered every bit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scoops it up once more.</span><br />
<br />
He has to watch the rainy drops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drip, dripping from the wall;</span><br />
Then, quick as anything, he stops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To go and roll his ball.</span><br />
<br />
Across the lawn he seems to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A funny little stick;</span><br />
So he must needs go hastily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And give the thing a kick.</span><br />
<br />
The laughing sunshine sifts right through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His mop of tangled curls;</span><br />
Turning it to a golden hue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kinking it in twirls.</span><br />

And then he hums with all his might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A funny little song;</span><br />
Some of the notes are almost right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some are sort of wrong.</span><br />
<br />
Then he must watch a lady-bird<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That crawls across the floor;</span><br />
Then listen! for he <i>thinks</i> he heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An awful lion roar!</span><br />
<br />
He has to stop and 'member things;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Once out at Gran'ma's house</span><br />
They was a birdy wiv red wings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kitty caught a mouse!</span><br />
<br />
"And then in Sunday-school one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The children all stood 'round,</span><br />
And sang a song 'bout why&mdash;delay,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">It had a lovely sound."</span><br />
<br />
Whatever can, or can't be known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He much desires to know;</span><br />
For suddenly his wonder-bone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has just begun to grow.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder what that birdy's at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over to Gran'ma's house.</span><br />
I wonder why a kitty cat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is 'llowed to catch a mouse.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why the doggie whines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wonder why he does;</span><br />
I wonder why the dandylines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All turns to fuzzy-fuzz.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why my shadow-boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hops fast along as me;</span><br />
I wonder why my newest toy<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So broken seems to be.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why they disappear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sharp and shiny tool;</span><br />
I wonder why my muvver dear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won't let me go to school.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why a deaded fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won't ever come alive;</span><br />
I wonder why I'm only free,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An Dorofy is five!"</span><br />
<br />
Each hour with wonder new is fraught;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he thinks so fast,</span><br />
He wonders what it was he thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he was thinking last.</span><br />
<br />
Wondering, singing, 'membering,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He learns anew each day,</span><br />
The world is but a bounding ball<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For him to kick in play.</span><br />

Next to the Epicure we turn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a discerning taste in porridge;</span><br />
Yet careful, lest her mouth she burn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the o'er hasty man from Norwich,</span><br />
For now, her judging powers have grown;<br />
She thinks with wisdom all her own.<br />
<br />
In tones that leave no room for doubt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She intimates she is unable</span><br />
To eat her bread and milk without<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her bear and dolly on the table.</span><br />
And nurse, because of her insistence,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Follows the line of least resistance.<br />
<br />
She does not want a nice clean dress;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's very, very sure she doesn't!</span><br />
She wants to go to Grandma's,&mdash;yes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wasn't naughty,&mdash;no, she wasn't!</span><br />
And knows with wilful, shaking head,<br />
She does not want to go to bed!<br />
<br />
She doesn't want to speak her piece;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She doesn't want her hair all curly;</span><br />
She isn't Auntie's pressus niece!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She isn't mother's darling girlie!</span><br />
Then suddenly, a change pacific,&mdash;<br />
And her new mood is beatific!<br />

Cherubic smiles drive frowns away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She vows that she loves evvybuddy!</span><br />
She <i>will</i> be goody-girl all day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor get her shoes and stockings muddy.</span><br />
She will not go outside the yard;<br />
And she "loves muvver awful hard!"<br />
<br />
Sometimes the martyr mood appears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's good in meek, submissive fashion;</span><br />
Reproachful eyes show signs of tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And red cheeks hint a stifled passion.</span><br />
She wonders, "when she gets to heaven,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>If children go to bed at seven!"<br />
<br />
She favors games of "let's p'tend,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with an energy unfailing,</span><br />
She plays the role of calling friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dressed up in anything that's trailing.</span><br />
From, "Ding-a-ling!" "Come in"; a bow,&mdash;<br />
To, "Well, I must be going now."<br />
<br />
Her reasoning powers have come alive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mind is rapidly awaking.</span><br />
The sharpest bargains she can drive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conditions she is ever making.</span><br />
"I'll sing my song for uncle,&mdash;yes,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>If you will make my doll a dress."<br />
<br />
Her mind, obeying nature's law,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like morning-glory's soft unfolding,</span><br />
Fills with a deep, enchanting awe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those who are breathlessly beholding;</span><br />
And they exclaim, "Well, did you ever!"<br />
"She's surely going to grow up clever!"<br />
<br />
She dances down Life's primrose way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unconscious of her faults and merits;</span><br />
The grown-ups watch her at her play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they opine that "she inherits</span><br />
Her mother's gentleness; but still<br />
She seems to have her father's will."<br />

In the soft soil of little lives<br />
Affection quickly springs and thrives<br />

Its tiny tendrils Love puts out,<br />
Not knowing what it's all about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But glad to smile and sing.</span><br />
<br />

Often the raggedest of all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bids affection start.</span><br />
Unstinted love is gladly poured<br />
Upon the dolly so adored<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">By little Tenderheart.</span><br />
<br />
Now love grows very fast, and so<br />
The little heart will overflow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love will run to waste;</span><br />
It must needs fall on this or that,&mdash;<br />
The dog, the baby or the cat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite Catholic its taste.</span><br />
<br />
Perhaps a schoolmate gets a share;<br />
The little girl with braided hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sits next in the class;</span><br />
The one with wide, pathetic eyes,<br />
Blue as the warm midsummer skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A timid little lass.</span><br />

A bashful glance,&mdash;a furtive look,&mdash;<br />
Some words about a lesson book;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then a smile or two.</span><br />
Then,&mdash;"You're the nicest girl I know!"<br />
And, "So are you!" "I love you so."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, "So do I love you!"</span><br />
<br />
Together arm in arm they walk,<br />
They do not care for others' talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor with the others play;</span><br />
In softest whispers they impart<br />
The secrets of each little heart,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Intimate friends are they.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, though fair and sweet the fruits,<br />
So fragile are affection's roots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A trifle works them ill;</span><br />
A single hasty word, or curt,<br />
The little tendrils oft will hurt;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A frown perhaps may kill.</span><br />
<br />
"She told me what you said 'bout me!"<br />
"I think she's mean as she can be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm mad at you! So there!"</span><br />
"I'll never speak to you again!"<br />
"All right, Miss Meany, don't you then!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You needn't think I care!"</span><br />
<br />
And then, just as the big tears start,<br />
Homeward runs little Broken-heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to her own room flies;</span><br />
"Dolly, my darling dolly, pet,<br />
You love me, dear, you love me yet!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She whispers with wet eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, human love brings but unrest,<br />
Once more she catches to her breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love that cannot fail;</span><br />
The love that makes her heartache cease,<br />
The love that brings a soothing peace,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No other can avail.</span><br />
<br />
Instinctive love, that can't be taught,<br />
That giveth all and asketh naught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reigns in one heart alone.</span><br />
Its own reward it can create,<br />
It makes the heart inanimate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Responsive to her own.</span><br />

Nothing is quite so hard, I think,<br />
As drawing maps with pen and ink.<br />
You dot the cities, every one,<br />
And make long lines where rivers run.<br />
<br />
And every single coasting line<br />
Must wave in curves as fine as fine.<br />
The rivers wriggle up and down<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Across the green and through the brown;<br />
<br />
You have to measure all the while,&mdash;<br />
A half an inch is 'most a mile.<br />
I do think maps are awful queer,<br />
They seem to bring the whole world here.<br />
<br />
Why, as I sit here in my chair,<br />
I see the countries everywhere.<br />
I see across to far Japan,<br />
With funny people, like a fan.<br />

All red and purple clothes they wear,<br />
And knobby hatpins in their hair,<br />
And flowers and trees of simple kind,<br />
And that big mountain far behind.<br />
<br />
Then, in the class, we have to give<br />
Description where the natives live.<br />
The countries that are colored pink<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Are where the natives live, I think.<br />
<br />
The people that live there, I'm sure<br />
Must be extremely sad and poor,<br />
With only rice and things to eat,<br />
And not a single shady street.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they ever think<br />
They live in countries colored pink.<br />
<br />
But drawing maps,&mdash;that isn't all;<br />
I was promoted in the Fall,<br />
And now I've lots of bigger books.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Reading is harder than it looks.<br />
<br />
You have to say your words just so,<br />
You mustn't read too fast or slow.<br />
It 'stracts you so, you can't find out,<br />
Sometimes, what stories are about.<br />
<br />
But reader stories, anyway,<br />
Are never very glad or gay;<br />
They're mostly 'bout some noble deed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>With fine, high-sounding words to read.<br />
<br />
And though it sounds quite loud and grand,<br />
It's pretty hard to understand.<br />
But Friday afternoon's the time!<br />
We all speak pieces made of rhyme.<br />
<br />
Next week, mine is the loveliest one,<br />
About "The South Wind and the Sun."<br />
It has such soft and singing words,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Like "lily-bells, and humming birds."<br />
<br />
The south wind and the sun, you see,<br />
Were comrades, just like May and me.<br />
And they went wandering all about,<br />
Just full of laugh, and gleeful shout.<br />
<br />
Dancing all springy on their toes;<br />
Wait! This is the way it goes:<br />
"Arm in arm they went together,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Over heights of morning haze.<br />
<br />
"Over slanting slopes of lawn,<br />
They went on and on and on,<br />
Where the daisies looked like star-tracks,<br />
Trailing up and down the dawn."<br />
<br />
Don't you think that is nice to say<br />
Upon a breezy, shiny day?<br />
Some poets just know how to write,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The loveliest pieces to recite;<br />
<br />
So many that I'd love to speak,<br />
And just one Friday in each week!<br />
But then I study other things,&mdash;<br />
The Civil War, and Saturn's rings,&mdash;<br />
<br />
I have to study hard, for, oh!<br />
There is so much I want to know.<br />
There's lots of knowledge, I suppose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>More even than my Grandpa knows.<br />
<br />
I look ahead, and seem to see<br />
That knowledge waiting there for me.<br />
I think, when I grow big and tall,<br />
I prob'ly shall have learned it all.<br />

When all the others are at play,<br />
Sometimes I like to go away<br />
And sit beneath the willow tree,<br />
And wait for thought to come to me.<br />
<br />
It's just the dearest quiet spot,<br />
Where I can think as well as not;<br />
And little breezes softly blow,<br />
That seem to make my feelings grow.<br />
<br />
And all the sunny, golden air<br />
Is full of living, everywhere.<br />
Then, with a happy little sound,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The branches murmur all around,<br />
<br />
So close, I scarcely can see through<br />
The willow leaves against the blue.<br />
Yet far less clearly can I see<br />
Through tangled thoughts that come to me.<br />
<br />
There seem to be, on every side,<br />
Doors suddenly flung open wide;<br />
Leading to places strange and fair;<br />
I want to go,&mdash;yet don't quite dare.<br />
<br />
I've been a little girl so long,<br />
That, somehow, it seems almost wrong<br />
To think how grown-up I shall be<br />
In days that have to come to me.<br />

And I am almost glad, at last,<br />
That I am growing old so fast.<br />

Cornelia,&mdash;she just wants to be<br />

But I should like,&mdash;I'm sure I should,&mdash;<br />

Some one like Joan of Arc, you know;<br />
Saint Katharine, or Mrs. Stowe;<br />

But likely I'd say no, I guess,<br />
Well, as to that, some thought I'd give;<br />

I'll have a softly trailing gown,&mdash;<br />
Blue velvet edged with snow-white down.<br />
But, such a robe as that to wear,<br />

The year was at its very Spring,<br />
A dawning glory filled the air;<br />
So marvelous, it seemed to bring<br />
A sense of something strange and fair.<br />
<br />
Slowly along the blossomed lane,<br />
Strolled, wondering, a girl and boy,<br />
Happy,&mdash;yet powerless to explain<br />
Whence came this new and mystic joy.<br />
<br />
The pinky blooms upon the trees<br />
Swam in a fragrant, rosy blur;<br />
And suddenly he knew that these<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Had not the loveliness of her.<br />
<br />
The knowledge made his heart stand still;<br />
Exquisite fancies filled his mind;<br />
He felt a power to voice at will<br />
Speech of the most exalted kind.<br />
<br />
Poetic lines sang in his ears,<br />
Strophes ran riot in his head;<br />
And, almost with a thrill of tears,<br />
"It&mdash;it's a lovely day!" he said.<br />
<br />
Unconsciously her hand met his;<br />
His simple nearness seemed to bless;<br />
She only murmured, "Yes, it is!"<br />
But all the world breathed tenderness.<br />

Again the raptured silence fell;<br />
There was no need of spoken word;<br />
For each was conscious of the spell,<br />
And each the silent music heard.<br />
<br />
From heart to heart the glad thoughts flew,<br />
Such sympathy the clasped hands gave,<br />
Her shyness made him timid, too,&mdash;<br />
His daring made her also brave.<br />
<br />
Joy's cup seemed suddenly to brim,<br />
With magic nectar, sweet and rare.<br />
He was so glad she walked by him;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>She was so glad that he was there.<br />
<br />
With silent lips and hearts aglow,<br />
They entered on life's Primrose way.<br />
Then, moved to speech, he cried out, "Oh!<br />
I think it's beautiful to-day!"<br />
<br />
She looked, unheeding, at the skies,<br />
She gazed, unseeing, at the blue;<br />
Then glancing straight into his eyes,<br />
She softly said, "Oh, I do, too!"<br />
<br />
A glory fell on each young brow,<br />
As, through an ever-widening rift<br />
Between the days of Then and Now,<br />
Shone promise of Life's fairest gift.<br />
